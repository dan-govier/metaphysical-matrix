        name: "Magician",
        description: "The matrix of the mind is the unmoved consciousness which makes everything possible. It is nonetheless impotent without potentiation from the female, unconscious mind, which resides behind the veil. Conscious in the illusion, the magician reaches beyond the illusion, to free the bird so that it can fly. In this consciousness are stored biases from previous experience. Consciousness remains manifest, while the unconscious never manifests. The magician is clothed in white, pure, prior to polarization or potentiation."

        name: "High Priestess",
        description: "The potentiator of the mind is the unconscious mind, intuition. This occurs beyond the veil, which adorns Isis here. Only with potentiation from the unconscious can action and experience occur at the conscious level. Our illusion has polarity for its foundation, denoted by the columns, and beyond our illusion resides that feminine unconscious. Semi-permeable is the veil, and the developments she brings can certainly be sought; Nothing here is more than half-obscured. Adorning her right body is the cloak which provides protection to those walking the right hand path, and note what the absence of such a boundary might mean to the other polarity. To the unconscious belongs the self as creator, the higher self, wherein catalyst is processed and formulated; the free will of the unconscious incessantly alters experience at the conscious level. Within the deep mind, the potentiator, resides semi-random pre-incarnative programming, which in the illusion will manifest to the entity as certain experiences demanding development."

        name: "Empress",
        description: "All that is perceived is perceived as catalyst unconsciously. And all catalyst must be consciously processed. The unconscious, after potentiating the conscious and instilling biases, ruminates, processing and formulating catalyst for the conscious mind once again. Here Isis is unveiled, the relationship between the unconscious and conscious now more permeable as the unconscious works to produce experiences and catalyst which meet the conscious mind at its conscious experience. There is a union here between cards 1 and 2. Note that the most efficient means of processing catalyst is meditation, in which arises from the unconscious a repository of reactions, biases, dispositions, sensations -- catalyst. In being seated to the side the unconscious has a tendency to retrieve catalyst which seemingly necessitates negative polarization. To each situation belongs potent potential for development, polarization, and catalyst; note the wand. After potentiation, the bird flies forth along its path. By some process catalyst yields experience, card number 4."

        name: "Emperor",
        description: "The emperor is masculine, conscious. The emperor is consciously, insatiably, processing the catalyst delivered to it by the experiences preordained by the unconscious. Catalyst is filtered through the veil for processing at the conscious level, and the veil never opens up and reveals all. As the emperor processes catalyst he inevitably polarizes, and note the contrast between the shades on his garments compared to card 3 -- here there is more distinction between the polarities as the entity picks one and consciously / unconsciously selects increasingly for catalyst matching that polarity, and interprets any catalyst accordingly. The clothes of Isis in card 3 aren’t so delineated along black and white, but reflect a blend. The bird has found its path. The emperor does not produce catalyst but fruitfully processes that which bombards it. He nonetheless intends particular developments, and in cooperation with the unconscious, produces those experiences for himself. To the right hand path is betrothed that protecting cat which protects commensurate with purity, and those walking the left find themselves separated increasingly from other selves; note the lopsided skirt."

        name: "Hierophant",
        description: "The significator is a simple and unified concept. It is the very nature of the mind, the totality, the unity of its unconscious and conscious vacillations. While the significator experiences, novel biases are recorded in the matrix, reflected further in the significator. Thus a significator is the product of all its previous incarnational experiences, biased accordingly. The significator of the mind foremost operates within physical reality -- perceive that environment which it has created for itself, and the illusion which binds his feat. For the mind needs the illusion to express itself. Either polarity finds the mind as its directing force -- the entities honor the hierophant at his feet. And they are switched with respect to their predicted spots, indicating that experiences of either polarity can yield polarization in either direction, simultaneously seeming to have yielded its opposite. The mind has for its purpose learning and development, certainly a product of free will, being confused and having forgotten its eternal source, and the mind is also a force of will. The significator is the mind intending, intending according to the biases developed and recorded via the rest of its complexity. His right hand signals other selves, and his left presages combat."

        name: "Lovers",
        description: "In transformation the conscious mind will have one of two relationships with its unconscious. Will the entity embrace temptation and exploit the spoils of its unconscious, realizing the arcane power therein? Or will it walk virtuously and peaceably with its source of potentiation? Here is a commentary on the way in which the entity uses resources -- e.g. the unconscious, catalyst, other selves -- and the path he finds himself walking. The entity is not pulled in either direction but stands still with the women. They merely indicate. Only according to his agency does he step forth, choose, and is transformed. To trod one path means abandoning the other. The entity in the sky targets the left hand path, offering that protection which is peculiar to the negative entity; facing the random catalyst of the illusion forthwith, the negative entity has developed in him that scrutiny and strength commensurate with his polarization and development. Such protection is for the self and by the self, incompatible obviously with those who see other selves as mirrors."

        name: "Chariot",
        description: "The way of the mind is not a product of spiritual evolution; it is not something obtained. It is rather the blueprint in which the mind and its sundry archetypes move. It designates that environment of the mind and how the mind traverses that environment -- apparently swiftly and pulled by its decisions in polarization. The timeless sphinges translate the mind between time / space and space / time, and the symbols on the conqueror’s shirt echo this proximity. The way of the mind embraces that new architecture entailed by the veiling process; with the veil half-lifted atop the chariot the mind navigates the physical and metaphysical. The scarab as well flits with the mind between both realities. The significator and the way are defined in their distinctions; the way acknowledges the whole environment while the significator does its work within the illusion. From the metaphysical the entity incarnates and uses the illusion to evolve, embracing and navigating the physical."

        name: "Balance",
        description: "The body according to its natural proclivities and instinct is always active, never inactive. It works in balance. This is the matrix of the body -- its state prior to the imposition of will and wisdom from its masculine counterpart (card 9). The body will begin to reflect the experiences gained by the entity, developing new biases and automatic processes. This state of quiescence is associated with the feminine, and to the masculine consciousness are hidden behind the veil so many functions of the body (e.g. heart rate). Note the veil on her face. Beyond the veil occurs such a wealth of significant bodily functions. The animals represent the unconscious instinct which is default in the body. Along with the seated entity, these animals are immobile, and await direction from a willing and informed consciousness. Prior to polarization the body will alternate between service to others and self according to its instinct -- only with conscious instruction does the body begin to polarize and develop with novel biases. The body and its instilled tendencies / habit patterns are inevitably balanced by karma."

        name: "Wisdom",
        description: "The matrix of the body is unceasingly active and must be consciously manipulated in order to make any use of it. Having learned through experiences, the wise man dictates the path of the body, overriding its unconscious tendencies. The wise man has obtained arcane knowledge and can govern some or all of those unconscious bodily process. As the wise man we can envision an entity who through seated meditation configures the body to his will, ignoring the cries of hunger, boredom, the sensations of pain and indications to walk and stretch. With the body unpotentiated the entity fails to determine his own development. With his square cloak the wise man belongs to the physical illusion, in which determining bodily activity plays a huge role. To develop a new set of biases and balance in the body, is a goal to which the entity calls himself."

        name: "Wheel of Fortune",
        description: "The entity is faced unceasingly with random and chance events. These events yield catalyst subject to polarized interpretation. Novelty is constant; the wheel spins and never ceases to provide catalyst and opportunities for polarization. Entities polarized in either direction or maintaining certain roles in the illusion -- each is subject equally to the incalculability of events. The set of biases the entity contains is potentially irrelevant in the face of novel, unpredicted experience. All entities are subject to such experience, regardless of their experience thus far or their position in the illusion. Nonetheless the wheel is upheld by two columns of polarization, for these interpretations are always available though the catalyst alters incessantly."

        name: "Enchantress",
        description: "The experience of the body reflects the catalyst that has been processed. The entity now has instilled in it a new set of biases, operating automatically. We have here the female, the unconscious. These newfound proclivities lead the entity forth effortlessly with incomprehensible strength and desire, leading the entity irrationally and with a foolhardiness to potentially dangerous situations which merely abrade and concede to her presence. The external environment conforms to the desires and intentions of the entity. The bird sits quiescently atop the enchantress, complacent with its current balance and activity, postponing its next sojourn."

        name: "Hanged Man",
        description: "All shall die in the third density illusion. The body is sacrificed for polarization, development, and the processing of catalyst. This is what martyrdom here means. Not necessarily is this card to capture instances wherein the entity sacrifices himself for some greater ideal, purpose or community, although any such interpretation is obvious and intuitive. The body, in any sense, by the end of a life, has been sacrificed -- especially its purely physical rendition, being ephemeral, is most effectively used as a means for development. The body, as part of the illusion, impacts and effects the illusion, leaving behind its influence -- note the gold coins which drop from the hanged man’s hands, and remain in the illusion. The martyr realizes that the body is a tool for development and polarization, and sacrifices it accordingly. The body is sacrificed necessarily, for all shall die in the illusion."

        id: 13,
        name: "Death",
        description: "Each moment and each day offers death and rebirth. Previous bodies die and rebirth is a product of processed catalyst. Such a transformation kills old biases and introduces new ones, which will be reflected in the activities of the entity henceforth, until transformation occurs again. Sankharas are released -- habit patterns of the mind, strict mental dispositions, are dissolved and their corresponding bodily sensations are reset or reconfigured. The body is rewired, to no longer reflect extirpated habit patterns. Emphasized in the card is the universality of this experience, for the skeleton inhabits each. And all the terrifying associations with death are not inappropriate -- transformation demands divestment of that which has been comfortable and somewhere useful for the entity. Transformation yields the rainbow, which of course spans the seven vibrations, the seven chakras, each corresponding to a color. The martyr is masculine, masculine being the obverse of the feminine / unconscious / metaphysical."

        id: 14,
        name: "Alchemist",
        description: "The body is a physical reflection of the metaphysical. The alchemist brings the metaphysical to vibrate into physical reality, pouring its liquid hence. The way of the body indicates an entity’s recognition of this material manifestation being derived from the immaterial, and the back and forth communication that can be intuited. Ourselves and our environment are a product of what occurs behind the veil. Like the chalices that the alchemist uses, the body is a vessel into which is poured the spirit. Realization of this fact could lend significant spiritual development; understanding the hybridized environment in which the body operates releases synchronicity from its mystery. It’s worth mentioning that just as the body reflects the immaterial mind and spirit, the totality of all manifested reality is merely the reification of infinite light and energy into intersectional physical units. Contrast the way of the body with the significator; the significator depicts a body situated tightly in the illusion, conferring death significance."

        name: "Devil",
        description: "The matrix of the spirit is that infinite black and primeval darkness, the unpotentiated void. Nothingness seems a proper characterization of the infinite black, but as the matrix of the spirit it is a plenum and source rather than a void. Associated with this card is the dark night of the soul, which for any entity proves utterly thrilling and necessitates the most solemn spiritual progress. Literally the entire physical illusion is shattered, as the devil burns its structures to the ground. The utter futility and insignificance of the ephemeral illusion undeceives the entity, for what is a life in the face of the infinite void? With nihilistic terror the entity is isolated in the great void from which it is derived and from which similarly manifest all great suffering and evil. Solipsistically the entity realizes that he must be that very thing which he’s ascribed evil to, unified and born from this colorless divine callousness. But only in the absence of light is something dark, so look to the torch which lucifer, the light bearer, bears with him. Thus illuminated and burned to the ground is that order of the illusion and all its conventions and values none of which is necessitated by the universe itself. The entity undeceived realizes the refractory will dredged from his own depths and its noncoincidence with the futile illusion, and proceeds to navigate, enlightened, according to the erumpent light (card 16) which spans the void."

        name: "The Tower",
        description: "This and card 15 are inextricably linked. This is fiery lightning in its purest form which elicits movement and structure from the great unlit plenum. It is interpreted in the finite illusion as cataclysm, a power sufficient for the levelling of life’s structures. Cast down indiscriminately are entities of low or high stature, exquisitely unconcerned such an experience is with social identity. Egos are indiscriminately annihilated by the light of the infinite. Cataclysm demands immediate and critical action, and spiritual development. The light is simultaneously constructive and destructive; this light which is easily interpreted as lurid is that which potentiates the void and elicits from the entity growth of a very deep, spiritual nature. Light animates the abyss."

    ({
        id: 17,
        name: "Star",
        description: "The catalyst of the spirit is hope, faith. Faith is a sentiment which induces change. Beyond conscious experience there is both the mind and the spirit which undoubtedly exist and support the entity, and faith is an undying belief in things which don’t elicit confidence in any traditional way, or in any way that belongs to the manifest illusion. Faith is undying belief in the unseen, the unity which is belied by the disjunct illusion of separation. Here is portrayed a unity, a wholeness between the vast sea of the unseen and the physical illusion, and actually as depicted the entity rests her legs on the vast immaterial plenum, finding there newfound support. Divested of her social conditioning, she rests naked. And thus disassociated from the miasma of illusion she inevitably in her nudity induces shock and disconcertion from anyone looking on; she’s misunderstood, potentially perceived as mad and errant. The star and all else come into meaning by the interplay of light and dark, which anyway come from the same source of the one infinite creator. This catalyst of the spirit is a faith and realization that there is no place absent from the creator, no darkness too profound, no terror too great; nothing can extirpate the self and its will."

        name: "Moon",
        description: "Moonlight potentially deceives in the darkness. Not all is clear. The spirit has to navigate this fundamentally deceptive illusion, encountering different experiences each of which is subject to a number of interpretations, given the murk of moonlight. Even when the light is realized within the illusion the entity still belongs to the illusion, and is still liable to the mystery, confusion, and must necessarily respond with free will by making choices. Thus the entity polarizes. The service to self adept will satisfy itself with the shadows and, grasping the light of day, will toss back the head in grim laughter, preferring the darkness. Alternatively even the most horrific of experiences are subject to illumined interpretation, and within the illusion the entity grasps the worrying shadows until the light of brightest noon shines upon the right hand path. Benighted by default the entity must seek its own path, interpreting and acting according to its own free will, polarizing thusly."

        name: "Sun",
        description: "The significator of the spirit might not yet be developed and is unlike the significators of mind and body in that regard. The significator of the spirit is the harvest of biases developed in previous incarnations (as are the mind and body), and offers the entity biases with which to meet new experience. The significator of the spirit radiates or absorbs the love and light of the creator, radiating it to others or absorbing it for the self. The adept’s development correlates with the degree to which it conducts this love and light. The significator belongs to the illusion; the entity dances in the light, but dwells upon the earth. There are two individuals depicted, male and female. In happy union the entity may commune with other selves, and the sexuality suggested by their being half-clothed doesn’t go unacknowledged. Alternately each of the two depicted may be interpreted as being simply the male and female aspects of one entity; the service to self entity lovingly embraces both the conscious and unconscious aspects of himself, isolated from other selves in his own circle, absorbing the sunlight of the creator."

        description: "The sarcophagus and mummification are intended for eternity. The spirit transforms the physical box of the illusion into something infinite and eternal. I.e., the lessons and experienced gained in the physical leave lasting impressions upon the spirit which it will carry into timelessness. Obvious is the entity’s being transformed out of physical being, called forth by the angel into different densities or astral planes. The spirit is infinite."

        name: "The World",
        description: "The spirit is the physical illusion’s relationship with totality. The way of the spirit is the world, the universe, the creator, everything. Through the illusion the spirit contacts intelligent energy and intelligent infinity. Intelligent energy is the creative energy of the Logos, capable of destroying, healing, transforming, with regard to self or other selves… etc. Contact with intelligent infinity is most likely to produce unspeakable joy in the entity. The way of the spirit determines the framework within which the work of the spirit’s other six archetypes occurs. In this card the entity flies forth completely uninhibited, governed merely by their will and intention. Effortless manipulation of the universe’s constructs and distortions is the way of the spirit, as the entity into the illusion assumes the identity of the one infinite creator. The three strings on the harp signify harmony in the mind, body and spirit. The entity is a microcosm of the universe, identical to all, omnipotent."

        name: "The Choice",
        description: "The choice is the choice in polarity that each entity makes along their path of spiritual development. The illusion and the experiences and all its mystery and confusion is intended to force the entity to choose. In its negative connotation this card indicates spiritual indecision or the lack of progress or polarization. It depicts an innocent entity encountering catalyst (crocodile) and disregarding it, not realizing the potential for development therein. Simultaneously he wanders in the light and dark of the eclipse. This archetype like the others can be used to promote evolution. It helps sharpen a basic view of the significators, and throws into starker relief the transformations."
